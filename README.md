# About me

Ahoy there. I'm Zander Toews, currently a collage student in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

I'm hoping to expand my knowloage in the computer science industry. The goal is to make websites and video games that I am proud to call my own, and one day help others achieve there own goals. 

My insperation for wanting to amazing create video games comes from the games Doom Eternal, Minecraft and Satisfactory. These games are ones I play offten and are my drive to make a game that will stand the sands of time and inspire others to do the same. 

The current programming languages that I have experience in are JavaScript, Node, C++. I also have experience in HTML and CSS.
