# About me

Ahoy there. I'm Zander Toews, currently a college student in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

I'm hoping to expand my knowledge in the computer science industry. The goal is to make websites and video games that I am proud to call my own and one day help others achieve their own goals. 

My inspiration for wanting to amazing create video games comes from the games Doom Eternal, Minecraft, and Satisfactory. These games are ones I play often and are my drive to make a game that will stand the sands of time and inspire others to do the same. 

The current programming languages that I have experience in are JavaScript, Node, C++. I also have experience in HTML and CSS.
