# About me

Ahoy there. I'm Zander Toews, currently a collage student in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

My insperation for wanting to amazing create video games comes from the games Doom Eternal, Minecraft and Satisfactory.

The current programming languages that I have experience in are JavaScript, Node, C++. I also have experience in HTML and CSS.
